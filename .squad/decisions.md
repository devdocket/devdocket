# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### 2026-04-17T18:00:02Z: User directive

**By:** Matt Thalman (via Copilot)

**What:** The coordinator must not do deep codebase exploration, multi-file reading, or detailed implementation planning itself. Fetch the issue description (via `gh issue view`), then immediately dispatch to the assigned agent with the issue context. The agent owns exploration, planning, and implementation. The coordinator's job is routing and supervision, not engineering.

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-04-17T12:20:36Z: User directive

**By:** Matt Thalman (via Copilot)

**What:** Always use git worktrees for parallel issue work. When Ralph spawns multiple agents to work on separate issues simultaneously, each agent should work in its own worktree for full isolation.

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

---

### 2026-04-15T20:02:05Z: User directive

**By:** Matt Thalman (via Copilot)

**What:** Never include the branch name in the PR title. PR titles should be descriptive of the change, not reference branch names, issue numbers, or other metadata.

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

---

### 2026-04-15T20:01:13Z: User directive

**By:** Matt Thalman (via Copilot)

**What:** Never include the issue number in the PR title. Issue numbers belong in the PR description only (via Closes #N).

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

---

### 2026-04-15T19:58:00Z: User directive

**By:** Matt Thalman (via Copilot)

**What:** Never include the issue number in a commit message. Issue references belong in the PR description only.

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

---

### 2026-04-15T19:57:47Z: User directive

**By:** Matt Thalman (via Copilot)

**What:** All PRs should reference in their description the issue they're fixing.

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

---

### 2026-04-15T19:26:30Z: User directive

**By:** Matt Thalman (via Copilot)

**What:** Each phase of the create-pr lifecycle between agents should be independent. Start remote review cycles while other agents are still doing local loops. No serialization between agents.

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

---

### 2026-04-15T19:13:21Z: User directive

**By:** Matt Thalman (via Copilot)

**What:** When Ralph is finished implementing a fix, he should run the create-pr skill (exactly, to the letter). The review loop mentioned in that skill needs to be done in an agent in parallel with other tasks.

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### Issue #243 — Version-Based Resurfacing for Re-Requested PR Reviews (2026-04-15)

**Issue:** #243  
**Author:** Fenster (Extension Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented

## Problem

When a PR review is re-requested after the user has completed their review (Done/Archived), the same `externalId` is already in the state store as `accepted`. The item never reappears in the Inbox.

## Decision

Added an optional `version` field to `DiscoveredItem` that providers set to a value that changes when the item needs re-attention. When `handleDiscoveredItems()` processes an `accepted` item whose stored version differs from the incoming version, it resets the state to `unseen`.

### Version sources by provider

- **GitHub PR Reviews:** `updated_at` from the Search API — changes when the PR is updated (including review re-requests)
- **ADO PR Reviews:** `lastMergeSourceCommit.commitId` — changes when the PR author pushes new commits (the typical trigger for re-review)

### Key design choices

1. **Optional field (non-breaking):** `version` is optional on `DiscoveredItem`, so existing providers are unaffected.
2. **Backfill without resurfacing:** When a pre-existing accepted item first receives a version (no stored version yet), the version is silently stored without changing state. This prevents a flood of resurfaced items on initial deployment.
3. **Dismissed items stay dismissed:** Version changes on dismissed items are ignored, preserving the fix from #189.
4. **Unseen items unchanged:** If an item is already unseen, version changes don't trigger any action.

### What was NOT implemented

- **Dismissed-item resurfacing:** Deliberately excluded — dismissed means "not interested," regardless of version changes.
- **Separate version-only update method:** Backfills are batched into the same `setStates` call with the existing state, avoiding additional API surface.

### Issue #233 — Provider Health Indicator Design (2026-04-15)

**Issue:** #233  
**Author:** Fenster (Extension Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

When a provider's background refresh fails (network timeout, auth failure, rate limit), the UI showed no indication. Items from the last successful refresh remained displayed, giving a false sense of currency.

## Decision

Track provider health in `ProviderRegistry` and surface it visually in Sources and Inbox tree views.

### Health tracking

- `ProviderHealthStatus` interface with `status` ('healthy' | 'unhealthy' | 'unknown'), `lastRefreshTime`, and `lastError`
- Health updated inside `refreshWithTimeout`: success → healthy, error → unhealthy with message, timeout → unhealthy with "Refresh timed out"
- `onDidChangeProviderHealth` event drives UI reactivity
- Health data is cleaned up on provider unregister

### Visual indicators

- **Warning icon:** Provider nodes show `warning` ThemeIcon (yellow, via `problemsWarningIcon.foreground`) when unhealthy
- **Description:** Provider nodes show "refresh failed" text when unhealthy
- **Tooltip:** Provider nodes always show a tooltip with provider name, last successful refresh time (relative), and error details when unhealthy
- **Unhealthy providers with 0 items:** Still shown in Sources tree so the warning is visible

### What was NOT implemented

- **Status bar item:** Considered but deferred — the tree view indicators are sufficient and don't clutter the status bar for users who don't use providers
- **Auto-retry with backoff:** Out of scope — providers already handle their own periodic refresh via `BaseProvider.startPeriodicRefresh`
- **Persisting health state:** Health is transient (in-memory only) since it reflects the current session's connectivity

### Issue #240 — URL-Imported Items Use Synthetic Provider ID (2026-04-15)

**Issue:** #240  
**Author:** Fenster (Extension Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

The "Create Item from URL" command creates work items from GitHub/ADO PR URLs. These items need a `providerId` and `externalId` for provenance tracking, but they don't come from a registered provider extension.

## Decision

Use `providerId: 'url-import'` and `externalId: <canonical URL>` for URL-imported items.

## Rationale

- Using the canonical URL as `externalId` is unique and stable — it won't collide with provider-assigned external IDs (which use `owner/repo#number` format)
- A synthetic `providerId` clearly distinguishes manually imported items from provider-discovered ones
- This avoids coupling the core extension to provider-specific ID formats
- If a provider later discovers the same PR, the different `externalId` format means no collision — both can coexist (the user may want to track it independently)

## Alternatives Considered

1. **No providerId/externalId:** Would work but loses the ability to detect duplicates or link back to the source
2. **Match provider ID format:** Would require the core to know about GitHub/ADO provider ID formats, creating tight coupling
3. **Use `providerId: 'github'`/`'ado'`:** Would conflict with the actual provider extensions' namespace

## Trade-offs

- URL-imported items won't automatically merge with provider-discovered items for the same PR
- The `url-import` provider won't have a display label in the label cache (falls back to showing nothing)

### Issue #250 — Show group context in all tree view descriptions (2026-07-24)

**Issue:** #250  
**Author:** Fenster (Extension Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented

Inbox items displayed only their title without any repository/project context. Other views (Queue, Focus, History) showed provider labels but not the specific repo/project. Users working across multiple repos found items like "Fix bug #42" ambiguous.

**Decision:** Show the `DiscoveredItem.group` field (e.g., `contoso/webapp`) in tree item descriptions across all views, in both flat and tree layout modes.

- **Inbox**: `group` in tree mode; `group · provider` in flat mode
- **Queue**: `group` in tree mode; `group · provider` in flat mode
- **Focus**: `group · state` in tree mode; `group · provider · state` in flat mode
- **History**: `group · state` in tree mode; `group · provider · state` in flat mode

**Rationale:**
- The `group` field is already populated by GitHub (`org/repo`) and ADO (`org/project`) providers
- `buildDescription()` gracefully filters undefined values, so items without a group are unaffected
- Minor redundancy in tree mode is acceptable for better scanability

**References:**
- Branch: `squad/250-inbox-show-context`
- Test coverage: All 970 tests pass

---

### Issue #232 — History Cleanup via Clear Old History Command (2026-07-24)

**Issue:** #232  
**Author:** Fenster (Extension Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented

The History view grows unbounded as items are completed/archived. Heavy users accumulate hundreds of items with no way to manage them.

**Decision:** Added a "Clear Old History" command (`devdocket.clearHistory`) that removes Done and Archived items older than `devdocket.historyClearDays` (default: 30 days). The threshold is based on `updatedAt` timestamp.

**Key design choices:**
1. **Threshold uses `updatedAt`, not `createdAt`**: An item that was recently archived (even if created long ago) should be retained.
2. **No ITaskStore changes**: `clearOldHistory()` reuses `WorkGraph.deleteItem()` in a loop rather than adding batch-delete to the store interface.
3. **Modal confirmation**: Uses `vscode.window.showWarningMessage` with `{ modal: true }` to prevent accidental mass deletion.

**What was NOT implemented:**
- **Auto-pruning / max history size**: Automatic deletion risks surprising users
- **Text filter/search**: VS Code's native tree view filtering already provides text search

**References:**
- Branch: `squad/232-history-cleanup`
- `packages/core/src/services/workGraph.ts` — `clearOldHistory()` method
- `packages/core/src/commands/commands.ts` — `handleClearHistory()` handler
- `packages/core/package.json` — configuration + command + menu contributions

### Triage Round 1 Summary — 18 Squad Issues (2026-04-14)

**Lead:** Keaton  
**Status:** COMPLETE

Triaged all 18 open issues labeled `squad`. Routed 17 to squad:fenster (feature & bug implementation) and 1 to squad:keaton (architecture decision #234). All issues received triage comments with complexity assessment, category, and implementation notes.

**Key Routing:**
- **squad:fenster (17 issues):** Features and bugs across AI actions, UI enhancements, inbox/queue/focus flow, onboarding, and history visibility
- **squad:keaton (1 issue):** #234 — Design decision for Done vs Archived state semantics

**Complexity Breakdown:**
- Small (5): #252, #228, #219, #217, #255
- Medium (9): #254, #250, #249, #243, #240, #233, #232, #226, #218, #215
- Large (3): #253, #225

**Implementation Sequencing:** High-priority unblocked issues (#228, #219, #217, #252, #255) can start immediately. Large coordination issues (#253, #254, #240, #225, #226) require careful sequencing due to dependencies.

### Issue #234 — Done vs Archived Distinction (2026-04-14)

**Lead:** Keaton  
**Status:** DECISION REQUIRED

Users are confused about the distinction between "Done" and "Archived" states in DevDocket. Need to clarify:
1. **Done → Archived lifecycle** — Should Done items automatically archive after N days, or require explicit user action?
2. **User-facing semantics** — Is "Done" = finished vs "Archived" = never see again?
3. **Provider closure signals** — Should GitHub issue closure auto-mark DevDocket item Done?
4. **History view organization** — Should Done and Archived appear together or in separate sections?

**Current Model:** Two terminal states in WorkItem state machine (Done and Archived) but unclear user-facing purpose and transition rules.

**Action Required:** Keaton to write design decision document clarifying semantics and transition rules, then Fenster implements based on clarified intent.

### BasePrAction Extraction Pattern (2026-07-22)

**Author:** Fenster (Extension Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented

Shared PR action logic (diff fetching, GitHub auth, LLM model selection, prompt loading with custom file support, workspace path validation) is extracted into `BasePrAction` in `basePrAction.ts`. `AiReviewAction` extends this base class and provides configuration properties plus a `getRuntimeInstructions()` method, while `AiWalkthroughAction` is a standalone `DevDocketAction` that prepares a worktree and opens the `@walkthrough` chat participant.

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates code duplication across AI actions that all follow the same fetch-diff → confirm → analyze → display pattern
- New actions require ~25 lines instead of ~240, reducing bug surface
- The code review action (`AiReviewAction`) has its own VS Code configuration section (`devdocketAiReview`) for a custom prompt path
- The walkthrough action (`AiWalkthroughAction`) uses the `@walkthrough` chat participant with a built-in prompt and has no custom prompt config
- Re-exporting `sanitizePrUrl` from `aiReviewAction.ts` preserves test backward compatibility without requiring test refactoring

**Implementation:**
- `packages/ai-reviewer/src/basePrAction.ts` — Added base class for shared PR action logic (used by code review)
- `packages/ai-reviewer/src/aiReviewAction.ts` — Refactored into a thin subclass of `BasePrAction`
- `packages/ai-reviewer/src/aiWalkthroughAction.ts` — Added lightweight action that prepares worktree and opens `@walkthrough` chat
- `packages/ai-reviewer/src/walkthroughParticipant.ts` — Chat participant with tool-use loop
- `packages/ai-reviewer/src/walkthroughPrompt.ts` — Interactive walkthrough prompt builder
- `packages/ai-reviewer/src/repoManager.ts` — Git clone + worktree management
- `packages/ai-reviewer/src/tools/` — 6 LM tools for repo access
- `packages/ai-reviewer/src/defaultPrompt.ts` — Updated review prompt with superpowers content
- `packages/ai-reviewer/src/extension.ts` — Registers both actions, chat participant, and LM tools
- `packages/ai-reviewer/package.json` — Updated metadata, added chatParticipants + languageModelTools contributions

**Test Coverage:** Existing review action coverage plus new walkthrough, participant, tool, and RepoManager tests — all passing at implementation time
**Result:** All relevant test suites passing at implementation time

### ADO State-Category-Based Filtering (2025-01-22)

**Author:** Fenster (Extension Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented

Azure DevOps work item states vary by process template (Agile, Scrum, CMMI, custom). Previously, the ADO provider hardcoded state exclusions in the WIQL query, which was fragile across different templates.

**Decision:** Implement two-layer filtering using ADO's **Work Item Type States API** to dynamically determine terminal states based on their **category**:

1. **Layer 1 (WIQL):** Exclude common terminal states (`Closed`, `Removed` only) for performance, preventing thousands of old work items from being fetched.

2. **Layer 2 (State Category API):** After fetching work item details, call the states API for each unique `(project, workItemType)` pair and filter out items where `System.State` is in a terminal category (`Completed`, `Removed`, `Resolved`).

**Implementation Details:**
- Cache key: `{project}/{workItemType}` — survives multiple refresh cycles
- Terminal categories: `Completed`, `Removed`, `Resolved`
- Fail-open pattern: If states API fails, return empty set (no filtering applied for that type)
- URL-encoding: Applied to org, project, and workItemType for API safety

**Rationale:**
- Works across all process templates without hardcoding state names
- WIQL filtering reduces initial data volume; states API provides correctness
- Fail-open ensures extension remains usable if metadata is unavailable
- Caching prevents redundant API calls for same work item type within refresh cycle

**Test Coverage:** 9 new tests + 16 pre-existing test fixes  
**Result:** All 132 ADO tests pass, 1124 total tests pass

### Four-View Model Architecture (2026-03-24)

**Leads:** Matt Thalman (via Copilot), Keaton (review)  
**Status:** Implemented

The extension now uses a four-view model: **Inbox** (unseen discovered items) → **Queue** (accepted new WorkItems) → **Focus** (in-progress items) → **Sources** (all discovered items grouped by provider/group).

**Key Design:**
1. **InboxState enum:** `'unseen' | 'accepted' | 'dismissed'` persisted as `discovered-state.json`
2. **No persisted item data:** Title/description/url/group read live from provider; only state index persisted
3. **Migration path:** Existing WorkItems with `providerId`+`externalId` seed state as `'accepted'` on first activation
4. **Dismissed items are sticky:** Providers cannot re-surface dismissed items in Inbox
5. **Accepted WorkItems persist:** Even if provider drops the external item
6. **View separation:**
   - `InboxTreeProvider` shows unseen DiscoveredItems
   - `QueueTreeProvider` (renamed from old InboxTreeProvider) shows WorkItems in New state
   - `FocusTreeProvider` unchanged
   - `SourcesTreeProvider` (NEW) shows hierarchical Provider → Group → Item tree

**Rationale:** Decouples provider discovery from WorkItem creation, giving users explicit control over what enters their queue via accept/dismiss actions.

**Implementation:** 10 steps completed (Fenster) + 57 tests (Hockney). All 121 tests passing.

### GitHub Package vscode Mock (2026-01-24)

**Author:** Fenster (Extension Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented

Created `packages/github/src/test/__mocks__/vscode.ts` extending the core mock with:
- `authentication.getSession` — returns `{ accessToken: 'mock-token' }`
- `workspace.getConfiguration` — returns `.get(key, default)` stub
- `workspace.workspaceFolders` — workspace folder detection
- `extensions.getExtension` — core extension dependency lookup
- `commands.executeCommand` — covers `vscode.openFolder`
- `Uri.file` — worktree URI creation
- `window.showErrorMessage` — error dialogs

**Rationale:** Each package owns its own test infrastructure to avoid coupling. Explicit mocking required since vscode is external.

---

### Code Review Fix Patterns (2026-03-24)

**Author:** Fenster (Extension Dev)  
**Context:** PR #1 code review by Keaton identified 7 Critical + 8 Important issues  
**Status:** Applied

Five key patterns established to prevent similar issues in future PRs:

1. **In-Memory Cache for Storage Layer** — JsonTaskStore maintains `Map<string, WorkItem>` as source of truth to eliminate read-modify-write races where concurrent saves could overwrite each other. Cache checked before disk reads; disk is purely for persistence.

2. **Git Operation Safety** — Always check preconditions before destructive git operations (branch existence with `git branch --list`, directory existence with `fs.existsSync`). Implement rollback for multi-step operations (delete branch if worktree creation fails).

3. **Stable External IDs** — Use `owner/repo#number` format instead of `html_url` to survive issue transfers between repositories. Requires parsing from url but provides reliable long-term identity.

4. **User-Facing Error Accumulation** — Accumulate failures across multiple operations and show a single user notification (e.g., "Failed to fetch from 3 repositories") instead of console-only logging.

5. **Immutable Updates** — Clone items before patching in `updateItem()` using `{ ...item, ...patch }` to prevent inconsistent state if `store.save()` fails.

**Implementation:** All 15 review issues (C1-C7, I1-I8) fixed by Fenster + 32 Copilot review comments addressed across 4 review rounds.

**Test Coverage:** Hockney updated 7 tests and added 3 new cases to match production changes. Final suite: 124 tests passing.

### Test Update Patterns (2026-03-25)

**Author:** Hockney (Tester)  
**Context:** 7 tests failed after Fenster's code review fixes  
**Status:** Applied

Four key test patterns identified during fix verification:

1. **Async Event Handler Testing** — Use `vi.waitFor()` when testing async event handlers, even if events fire synchronously. Prevents test timing assumptions from coupling to implementation.

2. **OS-Specific Path Separators** — Windows path.join produces backslashes; test assertions must match OS-specific paths. Use `\\` in test assertions on Windows rather than `/`.

3. **Mock fs for Filesystem Checks** — Use `vi.mock('fs')` with stubbed `existsSync` when testing filesystem precondition checks (e.g., before creating worktree directories).

4. **Git Operation Sequencing** — Test the full operation sequence including guards (precondition checks) and rollback logic, not just happy path. Updated call counts reflect guard checks.

**Test Improvements:** 
- Fixed 7 failing tests after production changes
- Added 3 new test cases for branch/directory existence checks and rollback
- Expanded GitHub package tests from 23 to 26

**Test Suite Metrics:** 121 tests pre-fix → 124 tests post-fix, all passing (98 core + 26 GitHub).

**References:**
- `hockney-pr1-tests.md` — detailed test update walkthrough
- Test files: `providerRegistry.test.ts`, `githubProvider.test.ts`, `startWorkAction.test.ts`

### Phase 2 Test Strategy (2026-07-17)

**Author:** Hockney (Tester)  
**Status:** Applied

Four core decisions:
1. **Mock helpers per test file** — each test self-contained, avoids cross-file coupling
2. **`vi.stubGlobal('fetch')`** — simpler than vi.mock for GitHubIssueProvider
3. **Callback-style `execFile` mock** — matches production code's `promisify(execFile)` pattern
4. **`vi.waitFor()` for async settling** — avoids coupling tests to implementation timing

Added 42 tests in Phase 2 (providerRegistry, actionRegistry, githubProvider, startWorkAction). Extended with 57 tests in four-view phase (discoveredStateStore, inboxTreeProvider, sourcesTreeProvider, migration, providerRegistry extensions).

---

### Issue #189 — Dismissed Items Resurfacing Fix (2026-04-11)

**Lead:** Fenster (Extension Dev)  
**Tester:** Hockney (Tester)  
**Status:** Fixed & Verified

**Problem:** Dismissed items re-appeared in inbox on subsequent provider refreshes.

**Root Cause:** PR review providers (`GitHubPrReviewProvider`, `AdoPrReviewProvider`) had `resurfaceDismissed = true`, which caused `handleDiscoveredItems()` to overwrite dismissed items back to `unseen` on every provider refresh.

**Solution:** Removed `resurfaceDismissed` entirely from the codebase. Dismissed items should never be resurfaced by any provider.

**Note:** An initial misdiagnosis attributed the bug to a cache race condition in `DiscoveredStateStore.getState()`. That theory was incorrect — the real cause was the explicit resurface logic.

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
